# eyes-movement
Project Description: This project builds two eyes with eyeball that move all around with the mouse scroll. Just move your mouse pad in any direction and the eyeball will follow. 

How to run: To see it in action, download the html, css, and javascript files provided, save these to a folder in your system then drag the html file into a browser. Converly you can branch the code to an on-going project.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, I would like to play around with different speeds of the eyeball movement, and with potential automation of movement so that the eyes move on its own.
